# FormVault
FormVault gives users the ability to save form templates and recover lost form data from any webpage.

Current features: 
* The ‘Undo’ button will restore autosaved data for a particular site. This data is stored locally on your chrome browser.
* The ‘Save Template’ button will create a template of current site’s form data. As long as the user has ‘sync’ enabled on their chrome browser, this data will persist offline and across different devices. Note that this button will overwrite previously saved templates.
* The ‘Restore Template’ button will retrieve the template saved to the site’s URL and fill the template data into the appropriate fields on the form. 
* The ‘Edit Templates’ button will open a new webpage with a table displaying all the user’s currently saved templates. Users can edit and delete templates from this page.
* The ‘Clear History’ button will clear all history - templates and auto-saved data. This data cannot be recovered.
* Works for all text elements, select drop-downs, radio buttons, and checkboxes.
